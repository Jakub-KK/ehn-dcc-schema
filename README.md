The main schema file is:

	DGC.schema.json

With the defintions in:

	DGC.Core.Types.schema.json
	DGC.Types.schema.json
	DGC.ValueSets.schema.json

For easy testing - they are combined in:

	DGC-all-schemas-combined.json

But the above 4 files are always leading.

The files:

	example*.json

are examples created in vitro & very artificial.
